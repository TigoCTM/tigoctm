+++

- These machines are **already in demand**, and Bitcoin users are screaming for more machines in more locations. There aren’t enough machines to fill the demand.

- **How much demand?** In the few cities these machines are found (not many), transactions range from $20,000 to $300,000 / month. 

- You keep the percentage you choose. **From 5% - 20%.**

- Your job is simply to find a location to place these high demand machines and pick up your profits.

- It’s as **easy as a vending machine**, except with vending machines, your profits rely on high traffic.
